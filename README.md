# coreos-nano

### Installation

Download https://github.com/broberson/coreos-nano/raw/master/nano.tgz and extract to your root directory:

```
cd /home/core
wget https://github.com/broberson/coreos-nano/raw/master/nano.tgz
cd /
sudo tar zxvf /home/core/nano.tgz
```

This will place `nano` in your path at `/opt/bin`. Supplementary files for nano are placed in `/opt/etc` and `/opt/share`, where this binary has been configured to expect them.
